# Hi, I’m Jack! 👋  
### I'm a software engineer and recent graduate of Imperial College London with a Master's in Computing.

💻 I have experience across several languages and frameworks, with a particular focus on JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and web technologies like React, NodeJS, Express and Tailwind.

🌱 I’m currently working on a mobile application, tentatively called **DayQuest**, which aims to help people build habits and accomplish goals by applying an RPG-like leveling and experience point system to real life tasks.
